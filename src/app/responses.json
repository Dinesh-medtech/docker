    "hello": "Hi there! I'm an Acarin Inc bot, How can I assist you today?",
    "how are you": "I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help!",
    "what is your purpose": "I exist to assist with tasks, provide information, and answer any questions you might have.",
    "what can you do": "I can help with many things like answering questions, explaining concepts, assisting with programming, providing recommendations, and more!",
    "tell me a joke": "Why did the computer go to therapy? It had too many bugs.",
    "what is python": "Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data science, automation, and more.",
    "who created python": "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.",
    "what are variables": "Variables in programming are used to store data that can be changed later in the program. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly.",
    "how does a for loop work": "A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item. Example: \n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n```",
    "what is an api": "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software systems to communicate with each other.",
    "what is json": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's often used to transmit data between a server and web applications.",
    "what is machine learning": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers use data and algorithms to mimic human learning and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.",
    "what is the internet of things": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects (things) that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.",
    "how to declare a function in python": "In Python, functions are declared using the `def` keyword. Example:\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    print('Hello from a function!')\n```",
    "what is recursion": "Recursion is a process in programming where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of a problem. It’s useful for problems that can be broken down into subproblems of the same type.",
    "what is ai": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and translating languages.",
    "how does blockchain work": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions.",
    "what is cloud computing": "Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services like storage, processing, and networking over the internet (the cloud), enabling scalable and flexible IT solutions.",
    "what is aws": "AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon, offering a variety of services such as computing power, storage options, and machine learning tools.",
    "what is serverless computing": "Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. AWS Lambda is an example of a serverless platform.",
    "what is a chatbot": "A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.",
    "what is git": "Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time, enabling collaboration on software projects.",
    "how to initialize a Git repository": "To initialize a Git repository, use the command:\n```bash\ngit init\n```",
    "how to create a branch in Git": "To create a branch in Git, you can use the command:\n```bash\ngit branch <branch_name>\n```",
    "what is sql": "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate databases.",
    "how to write a sql query": "Here’s an example of a simple SQL query to retrieve all rows from a table called `users`:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```",
    "what is an array": "An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, in a contiguous memory location.",
    "what is a class": "A class in programming is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have.",
    "how does inheritance work in Python": "Inheritance in Python allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability.",
    "what is polymorphism": "Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.",
    "what is a framework": "A framework is a collection of libraries and tools that help developers build applications faster by providing reusable components.",
    "goodbye": "Goodbye! Let me know if you need any help in the future."
